MV(1)                              Phoenix Shell Manual                             MV(1)

NAME
    mv - move (rename) files

SYNOPSIS
    mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DESTINATION

DESCRIPTION
    Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
    If more than one SOURCE is given, the final argument must be an existing directory.

OPTIONS
    -f, --force
        Do not prompt before overwriting an existing file.

    -i, --interactive
        Prompt before overwriting. The user is asked for confirmation.

    -n, --no-clobber
        Do not overwrite existing files. When specified, -f and -i are ignored.

    -u, --update
        Move only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file,
        or when the destination file is missing.

    -v, --verbose
        Explain what is being done. Print the source and destination paths
        for each move operation.

    --help
        Display this help and exit.

    --version
        Output version information and exit.

BEHAVIOR
    • If DEST exists and is a directory, each SOURCE is moved into that directory.
    • If DEST exists and is a file, it may be overwritten depending on options.
    • If DEST is on another filesystem, mv copies the file and removes the source.
    • The ~ symbol expands to the current user’s home directory.
    • If both -f and -i are given, the last option specified takes precedence.

EXAMPLES
    mv file1.txt file2.txt
        Rename file1.txt to file2.txt.

    mv -v file.txt /home/user/backup/
        Move file.txt into the /home/user/backup/ directory.

    mv -n report.txt existing.txt
        Skip overwriting an existing file.

    mv -i data.txt old_data.txt
        Prompt before overwriting old_data.txt.

    mv -u *.log /var/log/archive/
        Move only newer log files.
    
    mv -f protected.txt newfile.txt
        Force move without prompting for confirmation

EXIT STATUS
    0   if all files were successfully moved
    >0  if an error occurred
