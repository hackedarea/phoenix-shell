CP(1)                              Phoenix Shell Manual                             CP(1)

NAME
    cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
    cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

DESCRIPTION
    Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

    By default, cp copies files. When copying multiple sources, the destination
    must be an existing directory. If DEST does not exist, cp will create it if
    the -r (--recursive) flag is used when copying directories.

OPTIONS
    -r, --recursive
        Copy directories recursively, including their contents and subdirectories.

    -v, --verbose
        Explain what is being done. Print each source and destination pair
        as they are copied.

    -n, --no-clobber
        Do not overwrite an existing file. If the destination file exists,
        it will be skipped silently (or logged in verbose mode).

    -p, --preserve
        Preserve file attributes such as mode (permissions) and timestamps.
        Ownership preservation may be limited depending on user permissions.

    --help
        Display this help and exit.

    --version
        Output version information and exit.

BEHAVIOR
    • If multiple SOURCE files are specified, DEST must be an existing directory.
    • If copying a directory, -r or --recursive must be provided.
    • Hidden files are included when using recursive mode.
    • Destination paths are automatically resolved relative to the current working directory.
    • The ~ (tilde) symbol expands to the user’s home directory.

EXAMPLES
    cp file1.txt file2.txt
        Copy file1.txt to file2.txt (overwriting if necessary).

    cp -v file.txt newfile.txt
        Copy file.txt to newfile.txt, printing the operation.

    cp -r mydir newdir
        Recursively copy all contents of mydir into newdir.

    cp -n file.txt existing.txt
        Copy only if existing.txt does not already exist.

    cp -rp project backup/
        Copy a directory recursively while preserving timestamps and permissions.

EXIT STATUS
    0   if all files were copied successfully
    >0  if an error occurred during one or more operations
