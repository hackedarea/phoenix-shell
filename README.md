# üêö Phoenix Shell ‚Äî Custom Node.js CLI Terminal

**Phoenix Shell** is a lightweight, interactive command-line shell built entirely in **Node.js**.  
It aims to mimic the behavior of common UNIX shells like **bash** or **zsh**, while exploring how real shells parse, interpret, and execute commands internally.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core Shell Functionality

- Interactive prompt (`$`)
- Command parsing (supports multiple args, flags, and quoted strings)
- Error handling for unknown commands
- Built-in environment variable usage (`$PATH`, `$HOME`, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Built-in Commands

| Command               | Description                                                                                                                                             |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

- **Language:** Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Core Modules Used:**
  - `fs` ‚Üí File system access
  - `path` ‚Üí Cross-platform path handling
  - `readline` ‚Üí Interactive input
  - `process` ‚Üí Environment and working directory handling

### üß© Path Resolution

The shell includes a smart path resolver:

- Own Package Manager (`bae`)
- Handles relative (`./`, `../`)
- Expands tilde (`~`)
- Resolves absolute paths (`/usr/bin`, `/help/file.txt`)
- Normalizes redundant segments

### üß© Command Parser

Robust parser that:

- Splits arguments safely (supports `"quoted strings"` and multiple spaces)
- Distinguishes between flags, arguments, and paths
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility using `path.delimiter` and `path.join`

---

## üß† Learning Goals

This project is designed to:

- Understand **how real shells interpret and execute commands**
- Explore **system-level file operations** in Node.js
- Learn **I/O handling**, **process management**, and **environment variables**
- Rebuild small portions of a _UNIX-like command ecosystem_ from scratch

---

## üß™ Upcoming Features

- [ ] Add `touch`, `chmod`, etc. commands
- [ ] Implement piped commands (e.g., `cat file | grep text`)
- [ ] Add command history navigation
- [ ] Introduce shell variables (`x=5`, `$x`)
- [ ] Support asynchronous execution (`&`)
- [ ] Stores history of commands
